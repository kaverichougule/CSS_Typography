index.html
The HTML file contains the necessary structure for the webpage, including the 'html', 'head', and 'body' tags. <br>
In the 'head' section, there are meta tags for character encoding and viewport settings, and the title of the webpage is set to "Blog Website". <br>
The local stylesheet (styles.css) is linked to the HTML document. <br>
The content of the webpage is organized within a 'div' element with the class container. <br>
Inside the container, there are multiple 'div' elements with the class info to hold different sections of information. <br>

Each info section includes headings ('h2') and paragraphs ('p') to display the content. <br>

There's also an 'iframe' element embedded in one of the info sections to display a YouTube video. <br>

style.css <br>
The CSS file defines styles for various elements used in the HTML. <br>
The .container class styles the overall layout, setting it to a flexbox column and applying font-family and border properties. <br>
The .info class styles each individual section, setting the width and aligning the content to the center. <br>
The div selector styles all <div> elements, making them display as blocks. <br> 
Specific styles are defined for headings (h2), paragraphs (p), and iframes.
The styles for headings include font size and font weight.
Paragraphs are styled with a specific font color and display property.
The iframe is styled with border width and font color properties.
